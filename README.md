# Bitgrid
Using modern python to reify an idea from the 1980s

A bitgrid is an array of look up tables, each having 4 bits of input, and 4 bits of output (Up,Left,Right,Down)

A cell is programmed with 64 bits which cover all 16 input possibilities.

Someday I hope to have chips made based on this, to do exaflop scale computation.
